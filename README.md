# Unity 6 Game Jam Starter Pack

Hi there! I've been doing game jams for some time, and I thought that some ready-to-build Unity 6 starter could save plenty of time.

## What's included:

- simple top down movement (with easing)
- quality `.gitignore` combined from standard [Unity gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore) and [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/)
- `.gitattribute` (Line Endings, CRLF, LF, git-lfs)
- `.editorconfig`

## Future work

I want to create simple scenes from every genre with the basic environment, physics, and scripts: a ready-to-prototype environment or a starter boilerplate for your game jams.
